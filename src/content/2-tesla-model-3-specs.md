## Complaints with the Tesla Model 3

In May 2018, Consumer Reports branded the Model 3 as “not recommended” as it’s stopping distance during an emergency was worse than a Ford F-150 full-size truck. Tesla acknowledged the faults and released an [OTA update](https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model3-braking-software-update-consumer-reports/) for the anti-lock braking algorithm. Later, Consumer Reports changed their rating to a “recommended model”.

In Feb 2019, Consumer Reports again marked it “not recommended” as many customers reported to have problems like loose body trim and glass defects. Tesla reduced these flaws over time and later Consumer Reports marked it as a “recommended model”, again.

In 2020, Tesla used the 2.5 version processors because due to coronavirus outbreak the Shanghai factory was closed. After mass complaints, Tesla promised to upgrade everyone to 3.0 processor for free once the supply chain is restored.

That’s it.

Tesla Model 3 is also going to be launched for the very first time in India in mid-2021. Let’s see how everything goes.
